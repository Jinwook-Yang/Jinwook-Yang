## Backend Developer & Data Science
Hi üëã I am former backend developer and current graduate school student studying on data science.

I love studying and learning new languages via peer review and have interest on stabilizing web servers by reducing DB queries and API calls.

I am currently studying on data science and aim to be a professional on Machine Learning or Data management system.
